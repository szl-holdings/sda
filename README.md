# SZL HOLDINGS — SDA (Sovereign Domain Superiority)

A self-contained, mobile-friendly surface that explains and demonstrates **SZL SDA**, SZL's
clean-room sovereign **Domain-Superiority** engine — **`khipu-sda-core`**: multivariate + graph
anomaly detection and multi-sensor track fusion into a Common Operating Picture, a Λ-gated advisory
verdict, and a signed provenance receipt for every threat call.

SZL SDA is **inspired by** [True Anomaly's Mosaic](https://www.trueanomaly.space/mosaic) capability
(sensor-fusion COP, OODA acceleration, ML threat-warning). **SZL is not affiliated with True Anomaly**
and **no proprietary code was seen or copied** — the capability was rebuilt clean-room from public
descriptions and a verified-permissive lineage.

## What this shows

1. **Hero** — one investor sentence: anomaly detection + track fusion, with a signed receipt for every verdict.
2. **The capability (honest, plain)** — multivariate + graph anomaly detection, multi-sensor track
   fusion → Common Operating Picture, an **SGP4 orbital-conjunction seed clearly labelled SPACE ROADMAP**
   (today's live surface is **air / maritime / counter-UAS**), Λ-gated advisory confidence, and a signed
   provenance receipt per verdict.
3. **A live COP visual** — an elegant canvas Common Operating Picture: fused tracks as blips, an anomaly
   overlay coloured by score, a per-track anomaly-score panel, and a sensor-fusion convergence diagram.
   It reads the live killinchu `/api/killinchu/v1/mosaic/cop` endpoint when reachable (re-labels **LIVE**),
   and the **sovereign GPU fabric** via `a11oy.net /v1/compute-pool` with an honest **SNAPSHOT** fallback;
   otherwise it shows clearly labelled **demo data**.
4. **The moat** — a **verified verdict receipt** panel showing the honest DSSE-shaped fields (method,
   inputs hash, anomaly score, fused track id, Λ verdict allow/advisory/deny, conformal CI, walltime,
   verified flag), an "ask the fabric — verify a receipt" widget, and the **honest synthetic-data baseline
   metrics** with the clear caveat that they improve with real training.
5. **Where it fits** — powers **killinchu** (Track Board / Threat-DB / Mosaic COP view, PR #118), governed
   by **a11oy** (Governed Anomalies, PR #356), air-gap deployable via the **szl-sda** UDS bundle.

## Honest baseline metrics (synthetic data — REAL numbers)

From `khipu-sda-core`'s `szl_mosaic_validate.py` on synthetic tracks with injected anomalies (sustained
maneuver, RCS spike, heading weave); thresholds set from the calibration distribution, not tuned to the
test anomalies:

| Channel | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Point ensemble (iForest + AE + robust-z) | 0.44 | 0.74 | 0.55 |
| Graph-relational (GDN-style velocity dev.) | 1.00 | 0.35 | 0.52 |
| Fused consensus (0.5·point + 0.5·graph) | 0.40 | 0.70 | 0.51 |

Track fusion: 6 fused COP tracks recovered from 6 true objects across 2 noisy sensors.

**These are honest synthetic-data baselines, not operational accuracy.** The graph channel correctly
misses the RCS spike (no kinematic signature) — the right behaviour, not a bug. Numbers improve with real
training data and will be **re-measured on the live GPU fabric and re-issued with a real signed DSSE
receipt — never inflated.**

## Honesty doctrine v11 (badges shown in-app)

- **Λ = Conjecture 1** — advisory only (allow / advisory / deny); never "proven trust", never a false green.
- **Khipu BFT settlement = Conjecture 2** (advisory). killinchu **effectors = simulated**.
- **Orbital SDA / threat-warning = ROADMAP** — air / maritime / counter-UAS is live. The SGP4 conjunction
  stub seeds the roadmap; SZL does not claim to fly in orbit.
- Receipts ship honestly **UNSIGNED / verified:false** until a real DSSE signature is applied downstream
  (szl_lake / khipu Ed25519/P-256); **no signature is ever fabricated**.
- Anomaly scores, confidence bands, and all `$`/credit figures = **ESTIMATE**; walltime = **MEASURED** only
  where labelled. Synthetic / demo data is labelled as such. **No free energy.**
- **sovereign = own-metal only** — hosted APIs are labelled "hosted fallback — not compute you own".

## Tech / sovereignty

Pure static HTML/CSS/JS. **0 runtime CDN** — `three.js` r160 (MIT) is **vendored** locally under
`assets/three.module.min.js` (see `assets/THREE_LICENSE.txt`). The COP canvas, score panel, verify widget,
and fabric reader are self-contained. **System fonts only** (Calibri / system-ui stack). No server,
no build step.

Mobile system per the estate mobile spec: ≥12px font floor, ≥44px tap targets, `safe-area-inset`,
0px horizontal overflow at 320/360/390/768, `prefers-reduced-motion`, WCAG AA.

## Branding

Deep-space dark, teal `#01696F` / cyan `#3DD6FF` / violet `#7C5CFF` glow, glassmorphism, system fonts —
consistent with the cathedral / energy / khipu / llm-router / anatomy / mechanics estate spaces.
